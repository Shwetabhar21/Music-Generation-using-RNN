# ðŸŽµ Music Generation using RNN

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network to generate music sequences based on training MIDI data.

## Features
- Preprocesses MIDI files into sequences
- Trains RNN (LSTM) model for music generation
- Generates and saves new music compositions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- music21
- NumPy

## How to Run
Process MIDI files and train the model using the notebook. Then generate music samples.
